# Hospital Pharmacy Data Analysis Using Power BI
## Project Objective
The hospital management of a county referral hospital in kenya wants to understand patient visits, disease patterns, and pharmacy performance in order to improve resource allocation and decision-making.

## Dataset Used
[Hospital & Phamarcy Dataset](https://github.com/Musungu2/Hospital-Pharmacy-Data-Analysis-POWER-BI/blob/main/Hospital_Pharmacy_Dataset.xlsx)

## Analysis Questions
1. Which diseases are most common across counties?			
2. Does a higher number of patient visits always lead to higher pharmacy revenue?	
3. Which departments generate the highest pharmacy costs?			
4. Are there age groups that consume more medication than others?		
5. Are some diagnoses associated with longer hospital stays but lower pharmacy spending?

## Insights
1. Total pharmacy revenue amounted to Ksh 275,000, showing the financial contribution of the pharmacy unit.
2. Flu is the most common diagnosis, with Uasin Gishu and Nakuru counties recording the highest number of cases.
3. The Inpatient department generated the highest pharmacy revenue, particularly from patients in Uasin Gishu County.
4. Senior patients consume the most medication, accounting for 371 units out of 1,008 total drug quantities, indicating higher healthcare needs among older age groups.
5. Typhoid patients are associated with longer hospital stays and higher medication usage, suggesting more resource-intensive treatment compared to other diagnoses.

## Reccommendations
1. Improve cost management for long-stay conditions
2. Strengthen planning for common diseases
3. Support the inpatient department
